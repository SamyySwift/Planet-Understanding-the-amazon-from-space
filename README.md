# Planet-Understanding-the-amazon-from-space
This repository contains the notebook used to tackle the amazon deforestion challenge posted on kaggle. The notebook includes EDA, data preprocessing, building a convolutional neural network, and making predictions.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to track changes in the Amazon rainforest due to deforestation using satellite image data. The data has been provided by Planet and hosted on Kaggle as part of a previous competition — Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space. The labels for this task were chosen in collaboration with Planet’s Impact team and represent a reasonable subset of phenomena of interest in the Amazon basin. The task is a multi-label image classification problem, where each image will have one and potentially more than one atmospheric label and zero or more common and rare labels.
